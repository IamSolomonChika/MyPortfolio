Smart Money Concepts (SMC) is a trading methodology that focuses on understanding and following the footprints of institutional traders in the market. This approach helps retail traders align their trading decisions with those who move the markets.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Liquidity

Understanding how large players target areas of liquidity is crucial in SMC trading. Liquidity pools are areas where there is a high concentration of pending orders, making it easier for large players to execute their positions.

```typescript
// Example of a liquidity calculation
const calculateLiquidity = (orders: Order[]) => {
  return orders.reduce((acc, order) => {
    return acc + order.volume
  }, 0)
}
```

### 2. Order Blocks

Order blocks are significant areas where major moves originate. These are zones where institutional traders initiate their positions.

### 3. Market Structure

The market moves in a hierarchical structure:
- Higher Time Frame (HTF) dictates the overall trend
- Lower Time Frame (LTF) shows entry opportunities
- Market structure breaks indicate potential trend changes

## Implementation in Trading

When implementing SMC in your trading:

- Focus on higher timeframes first
- Look for institutional order blocks
- Identify areas of liquidity
- Wait for market structure breaks

## Benefits of SMC Trading

1. Better understanding of market movements
2. Improved entry and exit points
3. Reduced emotional trading
4. Higher probability setups

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how you might analyze order blocks:

```typescript
interface OrderBlock {
  high: number
  low: number
  volume: number
  direction: 'bullish' | 'bearish'
}

function isValidOrderBlock(block: OrderBlock): boolean {
  return block.volume > averageVolume * 1.5 && 
         (block.high - block.low) > averageRange
}
```

## Conclusion

SMC trading provides a framework for understanding market movements from an institutional perspective. By following these concepts, retail traders can better align their trading with the "smart money" in the market.
