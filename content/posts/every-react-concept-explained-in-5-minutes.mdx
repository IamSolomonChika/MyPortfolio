<p>React is a JavaScript library that allows you to develop front-end code in minutes. It has pre-built methods and functions to perform certain tasks. React as a library includes complex terms like reconciliation, state, props, etc. What do they actually mean?</p><p>In this article, you will learn about this exaggerated concept more simply.</p><p></p><h2>1. <strong>Components:</strong></h2><p>Components are small bit of reusable code that return a React element to be rendered on a webpage. It is a group of code that make up a single part of the webpage like buttons, navbar, cards, etc. It is just like a JavaScript function but returns a rendered element. It accepts parameters called <strong>"Props"</strong>. Components are named with capital case.</p><p></p><h2>2. <strong>JSX</strong></h2><p>JSX is JavaScript XML, which allows us to write HTML in React. It introduces XML-like tags and attributes to create React elements. It makes it easy to create React Components by letting you write HTML-like code in <code>.jsx</code> files. Instead of using complicated JavaScript, JSX makes the code readable and clean. React DOM uses camelCase for attribute naming such as <code>htmlFor, onClick</code>.</p>
